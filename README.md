# About the Project

The project is to make a website for Taleem Gah - a school for underprivileged children. The school
has bottlenecks with dealing with students' grades and assessing the institution's finances, due to their
records being kept on paper, therefore the aim is to help the school with this website project. The
website will include a financial account, where their budget and donors can be reviewed, as well as an
academic account, where teachers and administrators will be able to view and input studentsâ€™ grades
to generate student performance reports.

# Expected Deliverables

Our primary objective is to provide an interface to our faculty that will assist them in efficiently
administrating our institution.
We expect a fully operational website, which we can update accordingly from time to time. The
primary objective of the website is to provide an interface:
- that teachers can use to generate student reports at the end of academic terms, which can then be analyzed to gauge student performance.
- that administrators and financial managers can use to view, edit, and remove budgeting data as per their requirements and generate reports that can aid in gauging how to appropriately finance this organization on an annual basis.

Alongside this, we expect detailed documentation that will highlight and outline the expected
deliverables, with clear instructions provided as to how this product is to be operated and maintained.
